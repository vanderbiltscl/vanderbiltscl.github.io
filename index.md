## Grants


**Computing and Communication Foundations (CCF): Core Programs** ([Link](https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?WT.z_pims_id=503220&ods_key=nsf18568))

 * Deadline MEDIUM projects: `September 16, 2019`
 * Deadline SMALL projects: `November 14, 2019`

The Software and Hardware Foundations (SHF) program supports potentially transformative research in the design, verification, operation, utilization, and evaluation of computer hardware and software through novel approaches, robust theories, high-leverage tools, and lasting principles. Such advances may offer formal methods, languages, logic, novel software and/or hardware artifacts, or algorithms to enable new or enhanced functionality, verification, usability, and scale.


**NSF Cyberinfrastructure for Sustained Scientific Innovation (CSSI)** 

([Link](https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?WT.z_pims_id=505505&ods_key=nsf19548))

Deadline: `November 1, 2019`

Elements: These awards target small groups that will create and deploy robust services for which there is a demonstrated need that will advance one or more significant areas of science and engineering.

Framework Implementations: These awards target larger, interdisciplinary teams organized around the development and application of common services aimed at solving common research problems faced by NSF researchers in one or more areas of science and engineering, resulting in a sustainable community framework providing Cyberinfrastructure (CI) services to a diverse community or communities


**Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience  (CRCNS)** ([Link](https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?WT.z_pims_id=5147&ods_key=nsf18591))

Deadline: `November 25, 2019`

Computational neuroscience provides a theoretical foundation and a rich set of technical approaches for understanding complex neurobiological systems, building on the theory, methods, and findings of computer science, neuroscience, and numerous other disciplines.

**Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC): Research Core Program** ([Link](https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?WT.z_pims_id=505571&ods_key=nsf18567))

Deadline: `November 14, 2019` (only SMALL).


**NSF Computational and Data-Enabled Science and Engineering  (CDS&E)** ([Link](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504813))

Deadline: Depending on where to submit between `Sept 1st - Oct 15 2019`

Advanced computational infrastructure and the ability to perform large-scale simulations and accumulate massive amounts of data have revolutionized scientific and engineering disciplines.  The goal of the CDS&E program is to identify and capitalize on opportunities for major scientific and engineering breakthroughs through new computational and data analysis approaches.  The intellectual drivers may be in an individual discipline or they may cut across more than one discipline in various Directorates.  The key identifying factor is that the outcome relies on the development, adaptation, and utilization of one or more of the capabilities offered by advancement of both research and infrastructure in computation and data, either through cross-cutting or disciplinary programs.


**NSF Scalable Parallelism in the Extreme  (SPX)** ([Link](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=505348&org=CISE&sel_org=CISE&from=fund))

Not out yet.
Deadline last year: `January 17, 2019`.


**CISE Community Research Infrastructure  (CCRI)** ([Link](https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?WT.z_pims_id=12810&ods_key=nsf19512))

Deadline: `January 9, 2020` (letter of intent 12 November 2019).

The program drives discovery and learning in the core CISE disciplines by funding the creation and enhancement of world-class research infrastructure. This support involves developing the accompanying user services and engagement needed to attract, nurture, and grow a robust research community that is actively involved in determining directions for the infrastructure as well as management of the infrastructure.
